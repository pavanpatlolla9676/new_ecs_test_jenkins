Stage: Deployments
A) Create a Task Definition
What it does:
Defines a Docker container and its settings, which is necessary to run containers in Amazon ECS.

How to check in AWS Console:
AWS Management Console >> Open the Amazon ECS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/.
In the navigation pane, choose Task Definitions.
You can find and manage your task definitions on this page.
B) Create a Target Group
What it does:
Routes requests to one or more registered targets, such as ECS services.

How to check in AWS Console:
AWS Management Console >> Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.
In the navigation pane, under Load Balancing, choose Target Groups.
The created target group should be listed here for management and inspection.
C) Create ALB Rule
What it does:
Determines how the traffic should be routed to the different target groups.

How to check in AWS Console:
AWS Management Console >> Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.
In the navigation pane, under Load Balancing, choose Load Balancers.
Select your load balancer, navigate to the Listeners tab, and view/edit rules for the necessary listener.
D) Create ECS Service and Register with Target Group
What it does:
Allows you to run and maintain a specified number of instances of a task definition.

How to check in AWS Console:
AWS Management Console >> Open the Amazon ECS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/.
In the navigation pane, choose Clusters, then select your cluster.
Under the Services tab, you can create, view, and manage your services.
E) Tag All The Resources Created with Stage
What it does:
Helps in categorizing and organizing your AWS resources and manage costs.

How to check in AWS Console:
For Various AWS Resources:
Navigate to the specific service’s dashboard.
Select the specific resource.
Look for a Tags section, where you can view, add, or delete tags.
Post-Testing Actions:
After the testing is successfully completed, you can move on to the Go Live stage or perform necessary cleanups and validations based on the testing outcomes.






Go Live Stage
A) Create/Modify ALB Rule for Live Route
What it does: Adjusts the Application Load Balancer (ALB) rules to direct traffic to the new live target group, facilitating the blue-green deployment transition.

How to check in AWS Console:

AWS Management Console >> Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.
In the navigation pane, under Load Balancing, choose Load Balancers.
Select your load balancer, navigate to the Listeners tab, and view/edit rules for the necessary listener.
B) Attach Existing Staged Target Group to Live ALB Route
What it does: Associates the updated target group (new green environment) with the live ALB rule, directing live traffic to the new deployment.

How to check in AWS Console:

AWS Management Console >> Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.
In the navigation pane, under Load Balancing, choose Target Groups.
Select your target group, and modify the associated rules under the Load Balancer.
C) Tagging Resources
What it does: Updates tags on the new live resources to reflect their active state in the live environment, assisting in resource management and organization.

How to check in AWS Console:

For Various AWS Resources:
Navigate to the specific service’s dashboard.
Select the specific resource.
Look for a Tags section, where you can view, add, or delete tags.
Commit Stage
A) Delete Temporary ALB Rule
What it does: Removes any temporary or obsolete rules from the ALB, ensuring that traffic is not accidentally directed to outdated resources.

How to check in AWS Console:

AWS Management Console >> Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.
In the navigation pane, under Load Balancing, choose Load Balancers.
Select your load balancer, navigate to the Listeners tab, and delete unnecessary rules.
B) Clean Up Blue Resources
What it does: Deletes or terminates old "blue" resources that are no longer necessary, ensuring that only the relevant "green" resources remain active.

How to check in AWS Console:

For each AWS resource (ECS services, Target Groups, etc.):
Navigate to the specific service’s dashboard.
Select the specific resource and execute the deletion or termination process.
By following these instructions, you should be able to navigate through the AWS Management Console effectively and manage each stage of your deployment process from Stage Deployments, Go Live, to the Commit Stage.
